    "  Every large city has its own problems and although most people prefer using public transportation, NYC has always been considered as one of a kind in terms of its traffic. That comes at a cost, both literally and figuratively.  A city with millions of cars can’t be thought of without some parking violations taking place and for every violation there comes a ticket issued by the authorities.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  On November 14, 2023 a dataset containing all the parking violations issued between July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023 was published  on NYC Open Data Platform (1). It is provided by the Department of Finance (DOF). As can be understood by looking at the dates,  it has the data for the NYC fiscal year 2024. \n"

    "### About the Dataset\n",
    " This relatively large dataset consists of 43 features(columns).  It has more than 20 million rows of individual violations. It may also be worth mentioning that it is in a rectangular and structured format. Each violation is accompanied by a “Summons Number” which can be entered into “NYC Serv” site (2) to gain information on the ticket.  Since not all the features will be of my use, I will hereby give brief information on the ones I will need in order to do the analysis I intend. \n",
    " \n",
    " The “Issue Date” and “Violation Time” features showcase values of the day of the violation issuing and the hour and minute information, respectively. I was able to verify this by checking the exact tickets by entering their summon codes to the NYC Serve site. There, I was able to see the tickets in their original format. “Violation Code” column is the type of the violation. There is a list to see the descriptions of each code, under the dataset information in “NYC Open Data” site.  “Vehicle Color”, “Vehicle Body Type”, “Vehicle Year” and “Vehicle Make” columns are directly related to the specific cars as stated by their names. I included them as well. “Unregistered Vehicle” column is a binary column indicating whether the car was registered or not. In US, it is quite important to register a car after buying it. Each state has its own conditions and New York, the state which NYC is located in, requires a renewal every 2 years. Detailed description can be found on the “Department of Motor Vehicles, New York State” site (3). “Violation County” is another column which contains values of 5 counties of NYC. New York County (Manhattan), Kings County (Brooklyn), Bronx County (The Bronx), Richmond County (Staten Island), and Queens County (Queens). The last column I will be using is “Registration State”, just like its label, it is an indicator of the registered state for the car which the violation is issued for. \n",
    " \n",
    " There is one more dataset that I want to merge. I will be trying to find the hourly historical weather data for NYC. The columns I intend to add are Temperature(C), Rain(mm) and Snow features. For my purposes it is crucial for me to find the dataset with the hourly data at largest intervals. I wil also be mentioning why I need this specific data in the next parts of my proposal. \n",

    "### Obtaining the Data\n",
    " Open Data NYC provides API access to most of its datasets via SODA API. Upon reading its documentation (4) I’ve found ways to filter the data for the columns I wanted. I checked the “API Column Name’s of the features” I wanted to obtain and also defined a limit of data amount with “limit” expression. It has an SQL-like language, and it was relatively easy to use. I will request the data in JSON format, there is an option to get it in CSV as well though. \n",
    "An example of the API call can be seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** “summons_number” was only for my own purposes such as finding the regarding tickets as a violation. \"unregistered vehicle” column might not be used in the analysis because of the lacking data.\n"

Separating these will be possible by carefully inspecting the “violation code” feature and only including the type which can be associated with my needs for this analysis. \n",

I will share my initial analysis ideas here, but I would like to state that I will go further when I find something interesting while I am doing the analysis. I will both try to go over these ideas and also keep the analysis not just limited to here. \n",
    " \n",
    " I will start by the question whether I could find a relation with the hours the violation took place and the violation counts. I will graphically visualize the number of violations with respect to time of the day and try to draw conclusions. \n",

For so many, NYC is a great tourist destination to visit and thus, it is not their local environment.

    "### Prediction Model for Hourly Parking Violation Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "After the detailed analysis, I will be training a machine learning model in order to predict hourly parking violations. The way I will be doing it is like this: \n",
    "I will start by checking if my data is clear enough in order to be trained. Following that evaluation, I will do some outlier analysis. Since the first model I am planning to implement is a regression-based algorithm, I know how badly it can be affected by the outliers. I will find ways to minimize them. \n",

    "As I am trying to predict hourly data, my next step will be to group all the data by each hour. I will round the remaining minutes of the “violation time” column to nearest hour. I will have data point count equaling the number of hours a year has. \n",
    "At this point, hopefully I will have already merged the hourly historical weather data with my table and will have three additional columns namely, temperature, snow and rain data. I will have known their correlation with the violation counts by this time due to the fact that these are stages after the exploratory analysis. I will include them in my analysis if I get content with my findings. I may also think about binning snow and rain data to “None”, “Non to Little”, “Moderate” and “Heavy”. Doing one hot encoding will help me with featuring them in my model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature I want to add is the day of the week. Obtaining this will be the result of splitting the “issue date” column. Again, my initial analysis will tell me a lot about this valuable information. Before fitting, I will be doing one hot encoding to this categorical data as well. I will also consider adding the “month” as a new feature, it won’t be hard to encode them either. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will split the data into test, train sets and also do k-fold validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, I will have a set where most of my independent variables are categorical and my target variable is a numerical one. I will start with less complex models such as a linear regression and if they are not capable of providing a good fit (in terms of evaluation metrics I have), I will move on to more complex ones.  I won’t be needing scaling for a model like linear regression, it might give valuable information on coefficients but won’t change the predicted value, but in the case, I change my algorithm, I will be scaling when necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "As some features are not likely to have a linear relationship with my target, I will try different models to capture this relation. My first approach is to do a linear regression, but I acknowledge the fact that my data needs some adjustment in order for me to do so. For instance, I have the “hour” feature which is probably not going to have the relation I want. Well, I will try turning it to categorical features as each hour and do one hot encoding. That is one way I can think of in order to protect the linearity assumption for the independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will use typical evaluation metrics in the case I use this model(regression). “Mean Squared Error (MSE)” and “R-squared” will give me some insights. \n",

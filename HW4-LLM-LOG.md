# Question 1:

## Me: "https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1260/pg1260.txt"  I will get the text from this link in python using requests library.  However,  I only  want the text after some sentence and before some sentece. How do I do that?

## ChatGPT
To retrieve the text from a specific URL and extract the content between two sentences in Python, you can use the requests library to get the webpage content and then use text manipulation methods to extract the desired text. Below is an example code that demonstrates how to achieve this:

python
Copy code
import requests

def get_text_between_sentences(url, start_sentence, end_sentence):
    # Make a request to the URL
    response = requests.get(url)

    # Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Get the content of the page
        page_content = response.text

        # Find the start and end indices of the desired text
        start_index = page_content.find(start_sentence)
        end_index = page_content.find(end_sentence, start_index + len(start_sentence))

        # Extract the text between the two sentences
        extracted_text = page_content[start_index + len(start_sentence):end_index].strip()

        return extracted_text
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve content. Status code: {response.status_code}")
        return None

#Example usage:
url = "https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1260/pg1260.txt"
start_sentence = "*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***"
end_sentence = "*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***"

text_between_sentences = get_text_between_sentences(url, start_sentence, end_sentence)

#Print or use the extracted text
if text_between_sentences:
    print(text_between_sentences)
else:
    print("Extraction failed.")
In this example, start_sentence and end_sentence are used as markers to identify the beginning and end of the desired text. You can adjust these markers based on the specific sentences you want to use as delimiters. Note that the example uses the Project Gutenberg text of "Pride and Prejudice" as an example URL, so you may need to modify the code based on the structure of the content at your provided URL.


## Question 2:

# Me: I constructed a graph where my edges are the source and destinations cities for airline routes. I want to find the shortest path for a spesific city. How do I do that
## ChatGPT
To find the shortest path in a graph using NetworkX, you can use the shortest_path function. Here's a simple example assuming you have a directed graph where edges represent airline routes:

python
Copy code
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Creating a directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

 Adding edges (replace this with your actual edges)
edges = [('City_A', 'City_B'), ('City_B', 'City_C'), ('City_A', 'City_C')]
G.add_edges_from(edges)

#Drawing the graph (optional, for visualization)
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, font_weight='bold')
plt.show()

#Specify the source and destination cities
source_city = 'City_A'
destination_city = 'City_C'

#Find the shortest path
shortest_path = nx.shortest_path(G, source=source_city, target=destination_city)

#Print the result
print(f"Shortest path from {source_city} to {destination_city}: {shortest_path}")
Replace the edges in the edges list with your actual airline routes. The shortest_path function takes the graph, source node, and target node as parameters and returns the shortest path between them.

Keep in mind that this example assumes that the edges are directed (one-way flights). If your routes are bidirectional, use nx.Graph() instead of nx.DiGraph().

If you have weighted edges (e.g., flight distances or durations), you can use shortest_path with the weight parameter:

python
Copy code
#Example with weighted edges
G_weighted = nx.Graph()  # or nx.DiGraph() for directed graph

#Adding weighted edges (replace this with your actual edges and weights)
weighted_edges = [('City_A', 'City_B', 100), ('City_B', 'City_C', 150), ('City_A', 'City_C', 120)]
G_weighted.add_weighted_edges_from(weighted_edges)

#Specify the source and destination cities
source_city = 'City_A'
destination_city = 'City_C'

#Find the shortest path based on weights
shortest_path_weighted = nx.shortest_path(G_weighted, source=source_city, target=destination_city, weight='weight')

#Print the result
print(f"Shortest path from {source_city} to {destination_city} with weights: {shortest_path_weighted}")
Adjust the code according to your specific graph structure and data.


### Question 3

## Me :how to find the longest shortest path in the graph

## ChatGPT
Finding the longest shortest path in a graph is equivalent to finding the diameter of the graph, which is the length of the longest shortest path between any two vertices. There isn't a direct formula for finding the diameter, and it generally involves computing the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices and selecting the maximum.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can find the diameter of a graph using NetworkX in Python:

Create a Graph:
Create a directed or undirected graph using the networkx library.
python
Copy code
import networkx as nx

#Create a graph (replace this with your graph creation method)
G = nx.Graph()
#Add edges and nodes as needed
Compute All Pair Shortest Paths:
Use the nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length function to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
python
Copy code
all_shortest_paths = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G))
Find the Maximum Shortest Path:
Iterate through the shortest path lengths to find the maximum.
python
Copy code
diameter = 0
for source, paths in all_shortest_paths.items():
    max_path_length = max(paths.values())
    if max_path_length > diameter:
        diameter = max_path_length

print("Diameter of the graph:", diameter)
Keep in mind that computing all pair shortest paths can be computationally expensive, especially for large graphs. If your graph is very large, consider using a more efficient algorithm or approximation techniques depending on your specific use case.

Additionally, the efficiency of the code may depend on the characteristics of your graph (dense or sparse) and its size.

## Me (Follow up question )  User:
and could it also give me which path that is


## ChatGPT
Yes, you can modify the code to keep track of the specific paths that contribute to the diameter. Here's an updated version of the code that stores the paths along with the diameter:

python
Copy code
import networkx as nx

#Create a graph (replace this with your graph creation method)
G = nx.Graph()
#Add edges and nodes as needed

#Compute all pair shortest paths
all_shortest_paths = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G))

#Initialize variables to store the diameter and corresponding paths
diameter = 0
diameter_paths = []

#Iterate through the shortest path lengths to find the maximum
for source, paths in all_shortest_paths.items():
    for target, path_length in paths.items():
        if path_length > diameter:
            diameter = path_length
            diameter_paths = [(source, target, nx.shortest_path(G, source, target))]
        elif path_length == diameter:
            diameter_paths.append((source, target, nx.shortest_path(G, source, target)))

print("Diameter of the graph:", diameter)
print("Paths contributing to the diameter:")
for source, target, path in diameter_paths:
    print(f"From {source} to {target}: {path}")
This code maintains a list diameter_paths that stores tuples of the source node, target node, and the specific path between them. If there are multiple paths with the same diameter, all of them will be included in the output.

Keep in mind that storing the paths may increase memory usage, especially for large graphs, so use this approach judiciously based on the size and characteristics of your graph.





# Question 4: how to use tsv files in pandas

## ChatGPT
In Pandas, you can use the pd.read_csv function to read TSV (Tab-Separated Values) files. The key is to specify the sep parameter, which indicates the delimiter used in the file. For TSV files, the delimiter is a tab character ('\t'). Here's an example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Specify the path to your TSV file
tsv_file_path = 'your_file.tsv'

#Read the TSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(tsv_file_path, sep='\t')

#Display the DataFrame
print(df)
This assumes that your TSV file is structured with tabs separating the values, and the first row contains column headers.

If you have a DataFrame and want to save it to a TSV file, you can use the to_csv function with the sep parameter:

python
Copy code
#Specify the path for saving the TSV file
output_tsv_file_path = 'output_file.tsv'

#Save the DataFrame to a TSV file
df.to_csv(output_tsv_file_path, sep='\t', index=False)
In this example, index=False prevents the index column from being written to the file.

Adjust the file paths and column separators based on your specific TSV file and DataFrame structure.




# *** The next question of mine is about the second question. This log is really really long because I wanted my llm to change a lot of things. 

## My question 5:In my local machine, I have stored many voice recordings from many different people. They each have a file, where there are many wav files for them. Could you create a machine learning model to distinguish who is who? but first please help me getting the war files to python and labeling them. 

### ChatGPT
Certainly, I can guide you on the process of building a machine learning model to distinguish between different voices based on their audio recordings. Here's a simplified step-by-step guide. Please note that creating a robust voice recognition model involves more intricate details and considerations, but this should give you a starting point.

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas librosa sklearn
Step 2: Load and Preprocess the Audio Data

python
Copy code
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

#Function to extract features from audio files
def extract_features(file_path):
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, res_type='kaiser_fast')
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

#Path to the directory containing audio files
data_dir = "path/to/your/audio/files"

#List to store features and labels
features = []
labels = []

#Loop through each file in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(data_dir):
    if filename.endswith(".wav"):
        file_path = os.path.join(data_dir, filename)
        label = filename.split("_")[0]  # Assuming filenames are in the format "label_file.wav"
        features.append(extract_features(file_path))
        labels.append(label)

#Convert labels to numerical values
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)

#Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Step 3: Train a Machine Learning Model

python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

#Create and train a RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

#Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

#Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
This is a basic example using the Random Forest classifier. Depending on your dataset and requirements, you may need to explore other models, hyperparameter tuning, and more advanced feature extraction techniques.

Remember to replace "path/to/your/audio/files" with the actual path to your audio files. This code assumes that the files are named in a way that allows extracting labels. Adjust the label extraction accordingly if your filenames have a different structure.

Keep in mind that voice recognition is a complex task, and the performance of the model will depend on various factors, including the quality and diversity of your dataset. Consider exploring more advanced models like deep neural networks for better results.

User
I will write a path but inside that folder there are other folders and inside them I have my wav files. Each file should be labeled to their own file name. Could you do it
ChatGPT
Certainly! If your audio files are organized in subdirectories within the main directory, and each subdirectory corresponds to a different person, you can modify the code accordingly. Here's an updated version:

python
Copy code
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

#Function to extract features from audio files
def extract_features(file_path):
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, res_type='kaiser_fast')
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

#Path to the main directory containing subdirectories with audio files
main_dir = "path/to/your/main/directory"

#List to store features and labels
features = []
labels = []

#Loop through each subdirectory in the main directory
for sub_dir in os.listdir(main_dir):
    sub_dir_path = os.path.join(main_dir, sub_dir)
    
    if os.path.isdir(sub_dir_path):
        # Loop through each file in the subdirectory
        for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path):
            if filename.endswith(".wav"):
                file_path = os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)
                label = sub_dir  # Use the subdirectory name as the label
                features.append(extract_features(file_path))
                labels.append(label)

#Convert labels to numerical values
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)

#Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
This code assumes that each subdirectory contains audio files of a single person, and the subdirectory name is used as the label. Adjust the paths accordingly to match your directory structure.

The rest of the training and model evaluation steps remain the same as in the previous code example. You can use a machine learning model like RandomForestClassifier or explore other models depending on the size and characteristics of your dataset.

## me: is label encoder neccessary
### ChatGPT
The LabelEncoder is used to convert the string labels (e.g., names of individuals) into numerical values. In many machine learning algorithms, it's necessary to represent the target variable (labels) with numerical values.

For example, if you have three classes A, B, and C, the LabelEncoder will map them to 0, 1, and 2, respectively. This is crucial for training machine learning models, as they typically work with numerical inputs.

If your labels are already in numerical format and unique identifiers for each class, then you might not need the LabelEncoder. However, if your labels are strings or non-numeric, it's a good practice to use the LabelEncoder to ensure compatibility with most machine learning algorithms.

Here's how you can modify the code to skip the LabelEncoder if your labels are already numeric:

python
Copy code
#List to store features and labels
features = []
labels = []

#Loop through each subdirectory in the main directory
for sub_dir in os.listdir(main_dir):
    sub_dir_path = os.path.join(main_dir, sub_dir)
    
    if os.path.isdir(sub_dir_path):
        # Loop through each file in the subdirectory
        for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path):
            if filename.endswith(".wav"):
                file_path = os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)
                label = sub_dir  # Use the subdirectory name as the label
                features.append(extract_features(file_path))
                labels.append(label)

#Skip LabelEncoder if labels are already numeric
encoded_labels = labels

#Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
In this modified version, encoded_labels is assigned directly from the labels list without using LabelEncoder. Make sure that your labels are appropriate numeric identifiers in this case.

# ME:User :

Your code looks fine for loading audio files, extracting features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. However, there are a few points to note:

Label Encoding: It's a good practice to use LabelEncoder to convert string labels into numerical values, especially if you plan to use classifiers that require numeric labels.

python
Copy code
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)
Then you can use encoded_labels for training and testing.

Handling Class Imbalance: If the number of samples for each class is imbalanced, it might affect the model's performance. Make sure to check and balance the classes if needed.

It appears that there's an issue with importing the 'resampy' module. The error suggests that the 'resampy' module cannot be found. This might be due to the lazy loading mechanism used by librosa.

You can try explicitly importing 'resampy' at the beginning of your script to ensure it is loaded correctly:

python
Copy code
import os
import librosa
import resampy  # Add this line
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

def extract_features(file_path):
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, res_type='kaiser_fast')
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

main_dir = "C:\\EREN\\Datasets\\Voice_dataset"

features = []
labels = []

for sub_dir in os.listdir(main_dir):
    sub_dir_path = os.path.join(main_dir, sub_dir)
    
    if os.path.isdir(sub_dir_path):
        for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path):
            if filename.endswith(".wav"):
                file_path = os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)
                label = sub_dir 
                features.append(extract_features(file_path))
                labels.append(label)

# Convert labels to numerical values
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
This should resolve the 'No module named 'resampy'' error. If the issue persists, you may want to check if 'resampy' is properly installed in your environment by running:

bash
Copy code
pip show resampy
Make sure that the 'resampy' version matches the expected version. If it's not installed or there's an issue, you can reinstall it using:

bash
Copy code
pip install resampy
User
can you write me a code without that module
ChatGPT
Certainly, if you want to avoid using 'resampy', you can use the librosa.load function with the sr=None argument, which will load the audio without resampling. Here's an updated version of your code:

python
Copy code

This modification removes the dependency on 'resampy'. However, keep in mind that loading audio without resampling might lead to different sample rates in your dataset. Make sure your machine learning model can handle this variability or consider normalizing the sample rates before training the model.

User
could you give me a full code, also with the machine learning model please ? Including the normalizing
ChatGPT
Certainly! Below is a full code example that includes loading audio files without resampling, feature extraction, label encoding, normalizing the sample rates, and training a simple RandomForestClassifier. This example assumes that each subdirectory corresponds to a different person, and the goal is to distinguish between different individuals based on their voice recordings.

python
Copy code

import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def extract_features(file_path):

    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

features_normalized = [librosa.resample(f, orig_sr=librosa.get_samplerate(os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)), target_sr=max_sample_rate) for f in features]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_normalized, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
Please replace "C:\\EREN\\Datasets\\Voice_dataset" with the actual path to your dataset. Note that the accuracy of the model will depend on the quality and diversity of your dataset. For a more robust solution, you might want to explore more advanced models and feature extraction techniques.

User
Could you also create a confusion matrix 
ChatGPT
Certainly! To create a confusion matrix, you can use the confusion_matrix function from the sklearn.metrics module. Here's how you can modify the code to include the confusion matrix:

python
Copy code
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def extract_features(file_path):
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None)
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

main_dir = "C:\\EREN\\Datasets\\Voice_dataset"

features = []
labels = []

# Load and extract features from audio files
for sub_dir in os.listdir(main_dir):
    sub_dir_path = os.path.join(main_dir, sub_dir)
    
    if os.path.isdir(sub_dir_path):
        for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path):
            if filename.endswith(".wav"):
                file_path = os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)
                label = sub_dir 
                features.append(extract_features(file_path))
                labels.append(label)

# Convert labels to numerical values
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)

# Normalize sample rates
max_sample_rate = max(librosa.get_samplerate(os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)) for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path))
features_normalized = [librosa.resample(f, orig_sr=librosa.get_samplerate(os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)), target_sr=max_sample_rate) for f in features]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_normalized, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Create confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)

# Display confusion matrix using seaborn
labels = label_encoder.classes_
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=labels, yticklabels=labels)
plt.xlabel('Predicted Labels')
plt.ylabel('True Labels')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
This code uses confusion_matrix to compute the confusion matrix and then displays it using seaborn.heatmap. Make sure to have seaborn and matplotlib installed in your environment. You can install them using:

bash
Copy code
pip install seaborn matplotlib
This confusion matrix will give you insights into how well your model is performing for each class.

User
Could I ask to see only a small part of the matrix. How do I do that
ChatGPT
Certainly! If you want to display only a subset of the confusion matrix, you can extract a specific region of interest from the full matrix. For example, if you are interested in a specific range of classes or a subset of the confusion matrix, you can adjust the code accordingly.

Here's an example where you display a subset of the confusion matrix for a specified range of classes:

python
Copy code
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def extract_features(file_path):
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None)
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

main_dir = "C:\\EREN\\Datasets\\Voice_dataset"

features = []
labels = []

# Load and extract features from audio files
for sub_dir in os.listdir(main_dir):
    sub_dir_path = os.path.join(main_dir, sub_dir)
    
    if os.path.isdir(sub_dir_path):
        for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path):
            if filename.endswith(".wav"):
                file_path = os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)
                label = sub_dir 
                features.append(extract_features(file_path))
                labels.append(label)

# Convert labels to numerical values
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)

# Normalize sample rates
max_sample_rate = max(librosa.get_samplerate(os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)) for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path))
features_normalized = [librosa.resample(f, orig_sr=librosa.get_samplerate(os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)), target_sr=max_sample_rate) for f in features]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_normalized, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Create confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)

# Display a subset of confusion matrix using seaborn
subset_labels = label_encoder.classes_[:5]  # Display the first 5 classes as an example
subset_conf_matrix = conf_matrix[:5, :5]    # Extract the top-left 5x5 subset

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(subset_conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=subset_labels, yticklabels=subset_labels)
plt.xlabel('Predicted Labels')
plt.ylabel('True Labels')
plt.title('Subset of Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
In this example, subset_labels and subset_conf_matrix are used to extract and display only the top-left 5x5 subset of the confusion matrix. You can adjust these variables to display the subset of interest.

User
ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_test, predictions, normalize='true', cmap='bone_r')[:5,:5]
ChatGPT
It looks like you are trying to use the ConfusionMatrixDisplay class from sklearn.metrics to visualize the confusion matrix. However, please note that the ConfusionMatrixDisplay class doesn't have a direct slicing feature like [:5, :5] for displaying a subset of the confusion matrix.

If you want to visualize a subset of the confusion matrix, you can achieve that by creating a subset of the confusion matrix manually and then using the ConfusionMatrixDisplay class for visualization. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def extract_features(file_path):
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None)
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

main_dir = "C:\\EREN\\Datasets\\Voice_dataset"

features = []
labels = []

# Load and extract features from audio files
for sub_dir in os.listdir(main_dir):
    sub_dir_path = os.path.join(main_dir, sub_dir)
    
    if os.path.isdir(sub_dir_path):
        for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path):
            if filename.endswith(".wav"):
                file_path = os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)
                label = sub_dir 
                features.append(extract_features(file_path))
                labels.append(label)

# Convert labels to numerical values
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)

# Normalize sample rates
max_sample_rate = max(librosa.get_samplerate(os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)) for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path))
features_normalized = [librosa.resample(f, orig_sr=librosa.get_samplerate(os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)), target_sr=max_sample_rate) for f in features]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_normalized, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Create confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)

# Create a subset of confusion matrix (top-left 5x5)
subset_labels = label_encoder.classes_[:5]
subset_conf_matrix = conf_matrix[:5, :5]

# Display the subset of confusion matrix using ConfusionMatrixDisplay
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=subset_conf_matrix, display_labels=subset_labels)
disp.plot(cmap='bone_r', values_format=".2f", colorbar=True)
plt.title('Subset of Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
This example manually creates a subset of the confusion matrix and then uses the ConfusionMatrixDisplay class for visualization. Adjust the subset_labels and subset_conf_matrix variables according to your specific subset of interest.

User
I didnt use label encoding tho
ChatGPT
If you haven't used label encoding, you can directly use the class names as labels in the confusion matrix visualization. Here's the modified code:

python
Copy code
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def extract_features(file_path):
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None)
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

main_dir = "C:\\EREN\\Datasets\\Voice_dataset"

features = []
labels = []

# Load and extract features from audio files
for sub_dir in os.listdir(main_dir):
    sub_dir_path = os.path.join(main_dir, sub_dir)
    
    if os.path.isdir(sub_dir_path):
        for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path):
            if filename.endswith(".wav"):
                file_path = os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)
                label = sub_dir 
                features.append(extract_features(file_path))
                labels.append(label)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Create confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)

# Display the confusion matrix using ConfusionMatrixDisplay
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=conf_matrix, display_labels=np.unique(labels))
disp.plot(cmap='bone_r', values_format=".2f", colorbar=True)
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
In this modified version, labels are directly used without label encoding. The display_labels parameter in ConfusionMatrixDisplay is set to np.unique(labels) to ensure that all unique class labels are displayed in the plot. Adjust the code according to your dataset structure and requirements.

User
I would like to see only a small part of the confusion matrix
ChatGPT
Certainly, you can create a subset of the confusion matrix and display it. Here's an example where only a subset (top-left 5x5) of the confusion matrix is displayed:

python
Copy code
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def extract_features(file_path):
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None)
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

main_dir = "C:\\EREN\\Datasets\\Voice_dataset"

features = []
labels = []

# Load and extract features from audio files
for sub_dir in os.listdir(main_dir):
    sub_dir_path = os.path.join(main_dir, sub_dir)
    
    if os.path.isdir(sub_dir_path):
        for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path):
            if filename.endswith(".wav"):
                file_path = os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)
                label = sub_dir 
                features.append(extract_features(file_path))
                labels.append(label)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Create confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)

# Display a subset of confusion matrix (top-left 5x5)
subset_labels = np.unique(labels)[:5]
subset_conf_matrix = conf_matrix[:5, :5]

# Display the subset of confusion matrix using ConfusionMatrixDisplay
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=subset_conf_matrix, display_labels=subset_labels)
disp.plot(cmap='bone_r', values_format=".2f", colorbar=True)
plt.title('Subset of Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
In this example, subset_labels and subset_conf_matrix are used to extract and display only the top-left 5x5 subset of the confusion matrix. You can adjust these variables according to the subset of interest.

User
could you change the machine learning alghorithm. I want to get a higher accuracy
ChatGPT
Certainly! You can experiment with different machine learning algorithms to potentially achieve higher accuracy. One popular choice for classification tasks is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Here's an example of how to modify the code to use SVM:

python
Copy code
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def extract_features(file_path):
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None)
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

main_dir = "C:\\EREN\\Datasets\\Voice_dataset"

features = []
labels = []

# Load and extract features from audio files
for sub_dir in os.listdir(main_dir):
    sub_dir_path = os.path.join(main_dir, sub_dir)
    
    if os.path.isdir(sub_dir_path):
        for filename in os.listdir(sub_dir_path):
            if filename.endswith(".wav"):
                file_path = os.path.join(sub_dir_path, filename)
                label = sub_dir 
                features.append(extract_features(file_path))
                labels.append(label)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
clf = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Create confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)

# Display a subset of confusion matrix (top-left 5x5)
subset_labels = np.unique(labels)[:5]
subset_conf_matrix = conf_matrix[:5, :5]

# Display the subset of confusion matrix using ConfusionMatrixDisplay
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=subset_conf_matrix, display_labels=subset_labels)
disp.plot(cmap='bone_r', values_format=".2f", colorbar=True)
plt.title('Subset of Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
In this example, I replaced the RandomForestClassifier with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the SVC class from scikit-learn. SVMs are known for their effectiveness in classification tasks, but keep in mind that the optimal algorithm depends on the characteristics of your dataset. You may want to experiment with different algorithms and tune their hyperparameters to achieve the best performance for your specific task.

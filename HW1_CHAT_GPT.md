# I showed every single chat gpt usage of mine here, in this file. I explained each usage with my words on top of the questions. If I had more than one question in that spesific session I also highlited them. 



## My first question was about obtaining the data from an excel, where I had two sheets in file. I needed them seperatly. I used this for seperating the surface temperature and precipitation. I used the code chat gpt gave me.


## MY QUESTION_1: I have an API linking an excel file with two worksheets. How can I work with those two worksheets as two seperate data frames.

## ChatGPT


To work with two worksheets from an Excel file as separate data frames in Python, you can use libraries like pandas to read the Excel file and then access each worksheet as a separate data frame. Here are the steps to do this:

First, make sure you have the pandas library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
Use the pandas library to read the Excel file and access the two worksheets. You can use the read_excel function to read the Excel file and specify the sheet names as arguments to create two separate data frames. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

 Replace 'your_file.xlsx' with the path to your Excel file
excel_file = 'your_file.xlsx'

 Read the first worksheet into a data frame
df1 = pd.read_excel(excel_file, sheet_name='Sheet1')

 Read the second worksheet into another data frame
df2 = pd.read_excel(excel_file, sheet_name='Sheet2')
Now you have two separate data frames, df1 and df2, containing the data from the first and second worksheets, respectively. You can work with these data frames as needed.
Here's a complete example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

 Replace 'your_file.xlsx' with the path to your Excel file
excel_file = 'your_file.xlsx'

 Read the first worksheet into a data frame
df1 = pd.read_excel(excel_file, sheet_name='Sheet1')

 Read the second worksheet into another data frame
df2 = pd.read_excel(excel_file, sheet_name='Sheet2')

 Now you can work with df1 and df2 as separate data frames
print("Data in Worksheet 1:")
print(df1)

print("Data in Worksheet 2:")
print(df2)

 Perform operations on the data frames
 For example, you can do operations like filtering, grouping, merging, and more.
Make sure to replace 'your_file.xlsx' with the actual path to your Excel file and 'Sheet1' and 'Sheet2' with the actual sheet names you want to work with.


## My second question was about keeping the data frame as it is when using it in a function or doing operations on it. It gave me the   df.copy() method as an idea and I used it a lot in my tasks.

## MY QUESTION2: I assign a dataframe to my function in python. But it changes the dataframe itself , how can Ä± avoid it

## ChatGPT

If you're passing a DataFrame to a function in Python and the function is modifying the DataFrame in a way that you don't want, it's likely that you are passing the DataFrame by reference, which means the function is working with the original DataFrame object. To avoid modifying the original DataFrame, you can make a copy of it within the function. Here are a few ways to do this:

Use the .copy() method:
You can create a copy of the DataFrame inside your function using the .copy() method. This will ensure that any changes made to the copy won't affect the original DataFrame.

python
Copy code
def my_function(df):
    df_copy = df.copy()
    # Perform operations on df_copy
    # ...
Use the copy module:
You can use the copy module to create a deep copy of the DataFrame. This method is especially useful when you want to create a completely independent copy.

python
Copy code
import copy

def my_function(df):
    df_copy = copy.deepcopy(df)
    # Perform operations on df_copy
    # ...
Return a new DataFrame:
Instead of modifying the DataFrame in place, create a new DataFrame with the desired changes and return it from your function. This way, the original DataFrame remains unchanged.

python
Copy code
def my_function(df):
    df_copy = df.copy()  # Optional if you want to keep the original DataFrame as-is
    # Perform operations on df_copy
    # ...
    return df_copy
Choose the method that best fits your use case and ensures that the original DataFrame is not modified by your function.

## My third question was about changing the data types. I already knew df.astype() but I wanted to it for all columns quickly. I thought it would only work for column by columns , so I asked.   df.astype(float) was the way and I used this to change my column types in the first task dataframe.

## MY QUESTION3: I have a dataframe where all my columns have data type "objects". How can I change all to "floats"

## ChatGPT
To change the data types of all columns in a DataFrame from "object" to "float", you can use the astype method in the pandas library. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Assuming your DataFrame is named df
 You can use the astype method to convert all columns to float
df = df.astype(float)
This code will attempt to convert all columns in the DataFrame to float data type. If a column contains values that cannot be converted to floats, you might encounter an error. If that's the case, you may want to clean your data before attempting the conversion, or you can specify individual columns to convert using a dictionary with the column names and their desired data types. For example:

python
Copy code
 Convert specific columns to float, where col1 and col2 are column names
df = df.astype({'col1': float, 'col2': float})
This way, you can handle different data types for specific columns and avoid potential errors caused by incompatible data.



## My fourth question was about getting the data we needed for yfinance library, at the beginning of the second task. Well, one problem here was the fact that Chat gpt was not up to date. So I had to check the codes of the stocks one by one and found that the "FB" was changed to "META" . Apart from that it did a really good job.

## MY QUESTION 4: How can I use yfinance library to obtain the stock prices of Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Cisco, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, and Tesla between January 1st, 2019 and December 31st, 2022

## ChatGPT
You can use the yfinance library in Python to obtain the stock prices of the mentioned companies within the specified date range. First, you need to install the library if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
pip install yfinance
Next, you can use the following Python code to fetch the historical stock prices for the specified companies between January 1st, 2019 and December 31st, 2022:

python
Copy code
import yfinance as yf

#Define the list of stock symbols
symbols = ['GOOGL', 'FB', 'CSCO', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'QCOM', 'AAPL', '005930.KS', '1810.HK', 'TSLA']

#Define the date range
start_date = '2019-01-01'
end_date = '2022-12-31'

#Fetch the data for each stock
data = yf.download(symbols, start=start_date, end=end_date)

#Print the first few rows of the data
print(data.head())
In the code above:

We import the yfinance library as yf.
We define a list of stock symbols for the companies you mentioned.
We set the start and end dates to the specified date range.
We use the yf.download function to fetch historical stock price data for the specified symbols and date range.
Finally, we print the first few rows of the downloaded data.
Make sure to replace the stock symbols '005930.KS' and '1810.HK' with the correct symbols for Samsung and Xiaomi, respectively. You may also need to adjust the list of symbols or date range if necessary.

Please note that the availability of historical data and the format of the stock symbols may change over time, so ensure that the symbols are up-to-date when you run the code.

## My fifth question was about filling the null values in the columns with the previous column values. I explained my reasoning about this thoroughly in my HW. I used the function as it is.

## MYQUESTION 5: I have a dataframe in python and I want to change every nan element to the previous value in the column .How do I do that

## ChatGPT
You can use the fillna method in Pandas to fill NaN (null) values in a DataFrame with the previous non-null value in the same column. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Create a sample DataFrame
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, np.nan, 5],
        'B': [np.nan, 7, np.nan, 9, 10]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

#Use the fillna method to fill NaN values with the previous non-null value
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

#This will replace NaN values with the previous non-null value in the column
print(df)
In this example, method='ffill' stands for "forward fill," which means that it fills NaN values with the previous non-null value in the column. The inplace=True parameter modifies the original DataFrame in place. If you want to create a new DataFrame without modifying the original, you can omit the inplace=True parameter.

After running this code, your DataFrame will have NaN values replaced with the previous values in the respective columns.

## My sixth question was about creating a function which will assign 1,0,-1 values to my new data frame just like I was tasked and also fill the null values. Well the code didn't work like this. It still had null values. So I asked my previous question to chat gpt (to fill my table with previous column values) and then I took the transforming function here. I didn't need the previous value part here. Hence I changed the code that way. Also , I didn't understand the usage of lambda here at first. I asked about it as well and our conversation continued. Eventually , I got my answers. I showed all my following questions in this session with "ME" word.

## MYQUESTION6: I have a data frame and I want to transform it to another dataframe by converting values larger than 2.5 to 1 , values between -2.5 and 2.5 to 0, values lower than -2.5 to -1 , and lastly if it is a null value I want to transform it to the previous value in the column . How can I do that in pandas 
## ChatGPT
You can achieve this transformation using the apply method along with a custom function in pandas. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

First, let's assume you have a DataFrame called df.

Create a custom function to apply to each element in the DataFrame. This function will implement your transformation logic:

python

Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def transform_value(value, previous_value):
    if pd.notna(value):
        if value > 2.5:
            return 1
        elif value < -2.5:
            return -1
        else:
            return 0
    else:
        return previous_value
In this function, value is the current cell value, and previous_value is the value from the same column in the previous row. If value is not a NaN (null) value, it checks its range and returns the transformed value accordingly. If value is NaN, it returns the previous_value.

Use the apply method to apply this function to each element in your DataFrame:
python
Copy code
previous_value = None
for column in df.columns:
    df[column] = df[column].apply(lambda x: transform_value(x, previous_value))
    previous_value = df[column].iloc[-1]  # Update previous_value for the next column
This code iterates through each column in your DataFrame and applies the transform_value function to each element while keeping track of the previous_value for each column. It will produce the desired transformed DataFrame.

Here's the complete code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

#Sample DataFrame
data = {'Column1': [3.0, 1.0, -2.0, 2.6, 4.0, np.nan, -3.0],
        'Column2': [2.0, -3.0, np.nan, 5.0, -1.0, -3.0, 2.7]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def transform_value(value, previous_value):
    if pd.notna(value):
        if value > 2.5:
            return 1
        elif value < -2.5:
            return -1
        else:
            return 0
    else:
        return previous_value

previous_value = None
for column in df.columns:
    df[column] = df[column].apply(lambda x: transform_value(x, previous_value))
    previous_value = df[column].iloc[-1]

print(df)
This code will transform your DataFrame according to the specified rules, replacing NaN values with the previous value in each column.

## ME: how does lambda work here
## ChatGPT
In the provided code, a lambda function is used within the apply method to apply the custom transformation function transform_value to each element in the DataFrame. Here's a breakdown of how the lambda function works in this context:

The lambda function is an anonymous, small, inline function used for a specific task without the need to define a named function explicitly.

In the context of df[column].apply(lambda x: transform_value(x, previous_value)):

x is a placeholder variable that represents each individual element within the DataFrame column.
The lambda function takes x as an argument and calls the transform_value function with x as the value argument and previous_value as the second argument.
It then returns the result of transform_value(x, previous_value).
This lambda function allows you to apply the transform_value function to each element in the column while also passing the previous_value for the specific column. It's a concise way to apply a custom function to each element of the DataFrame.

In essence, the lambda function is used to wrap the transformation logic provided by transform_value and make it applicable to each element in the DataFrame using df[column].apply(...).

## ME: but how does x represent the elements
## ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding in my previous response. In the lambda function, x represents the entire column (not individual elements), and it passes the entire column to the transform_value function. This is not what you want for your transformation. You should iterate through the elements of the column directly. Here's the corrected approach:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

#Sample DataFrame
data = {'Column1': [3.0, 1.0, -2.0, 2.6, 4.0, np.nan, -3.0],
        'Column2': [2.0, -3.0, np.nan, 5.0, -1.0, -3.0, 2.7]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def transform_value(value, previous_value):
    if pd.notna(value):
        if value > 2.5:
            return 1
        elif value < -2.5:
            return -1
        else:
            return 0
    else:
        return previous_value

for column in df.columns:
    previous_value = None  # Reset previous_value for each column
    df[column] = df[column].apply(lambda x: transform_value(x, previous_value))
    previous_value = df[column].iloc[-1]  # Update previous_value for the next column

print(df)
In this corrected code, x represents each individual element within the column during the apply operation, and the transformation is applied correctly to individual elements in each column. The previous_value is updated for each column separately to handle NaN values in that specific column.




## My seventh question was about finding the longest repetitations of the number 1 in the DataFrame I created. Well, first it only gave me the count of those numbers however I also needed the index. I asked once again. Now there was a problem in my code. It gave me the iteritems() function in the code and I learned that it doesn't work anymore on python. I used .items() instead and it worked. One more thing to say here, I also used this code to find longest streak on -1 , I just changed the 1 to -1 in the code. I am adding all my conversation with my follow up questions here.

## MY QUESTION7: I have a dataframe where my index is dates and for each column I want to find the longest days in a row which those values are equal to 1
## ChatGPT
To find the longest consecutive days in a DataFrame where the values are equal to 1 for each column, you can use the following Python code. Assuming you have a DataFrame with dates as the index and columns containing binary values (0 or 1):

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Sample DataFrame (replace this with your actual DataFrame)
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-10-01', periods=10, freq='D'),
    'Column1': [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    'Column2': [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    'Column3': [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

#Function to find the longest consecutive days with value 1
def longest_consecutive_days(series):
    max_count = 0
    current_count = 0

    for value in series:
        if value == 1:
            current_count += 1
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
        else:
            current_count = 0

    return max_count

#Find the longest consecutive days with value 1 for each column
result = df.apply(longest_consecutive_days)
print(result)
This code defines a function longest_consecutive_days that takes a Pandas Series and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence of 1s. It then applies this function to each column in the DataFrame using the apply method.

Replace the data variable with your actual DataFrame, and this code will find and print the longest consecutive days with value 1 for each column.

## ME: could you also return the index number when finding the max
## ChatGPT:
Certainly! To return the index (i.e., the starting date) when finding the maximum consecutive days with value 1, you can modify the code as follows:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Sample DataFrame (replace this with your actual DataFrame)
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-10-01', periods=10, freq='D'),
    'Column1': [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    'Column2': [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    'Column3': [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

#Function to find the longest consecutive days with value 1 and its starting index
def longest_consecutive_days(series):
    max_count = 0
    current_count = 0
    max_start_date = None
    current_start_date = None

    for date, value in series.iteritems():
        if value == 1:
            if current_count == 0:
                current_start_date = date
            current_count += 1
            if current_count > max_count:
                max_count = current_count
                max_start_date = current_start_date
        else:
            current_count = 0
            current_start_date = None

    return max_count, max_start_date

#Find the longest consecutive days with value 1 for each column
result = df.apply(longest_consecutive_days)
print(result)
This modified code keeps track of both the maximum consecutive days and the starting date of that sequence. The result is a DataFrame where each column shows the maximum consecutive days and the starting date for values equal to 1.

## ME:iteritems didnt work
## ChatGPT
I apologize for the inconvenience. It appears there was a mistake in my previous response. To iterate over the index and values correctly, you should use iterrows() for a DataFrame. Here's the modified code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Sample DataFrame (replace this with your actual DataFrame)
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-10-01', periods=10, freq='D'),
    'Column1': [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    'Column2': [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    'Column3': [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

#Function to find the longest consecutive days with value 1 and its starting index
def longest_consecutive_days(series):
    max_count = 0
    current_count = 0
    max_start_date = None
    current_start_date = None

    for date, value in series.iteritems():
        if value == 1:
            if current_count == 0:
                current_start_date = date
            current_count += 1
            if current_count > max_count:
                max_count = current_count
                max_start_date = current_start_date
        else:
            current_count = 0
            current_start_date = None

    return max_count, max_start_date

 Find the longest consecutive days with value 1 for each column
result = df.apply(longest_consecutive_days, axis=0)
print(result)
This code should work correctly, iterating over rows and columns to find the maximum consecutive days and the starting date for values equal to 1 in each column of the DataFrame.
 
## My eighth question was about coding. Since I had the opening prices and wanted to transform them to percentage compared to the previous value in that column, I just asked this to chat gpt. It gave me the "df.pct_change()" and I used it.

## MY EIGHTH QUESTION:I have a data frame and I want each column to be transformed. I want each element as the increase or decrease percentage of the previous element in the column
## ChatGPT
You can use Python with libraries like pandas to achieve this transformation for each column in a DataFrame. You want to calculate the percentage increase or decrease of each element in a column relative to the previous element. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

Assuming you have a DataFrame called df, where each column represents the data you want to transform, you can use the pct_change method in pandas to calculate the percentage change from the previous element:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'A': [10, 12, 15, 18],
    'B': [100, 110, 105, 120]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

#Calculate percentage change for each column
df_percent_change = df.pct_change().fillna(0)

print(df_percent_change)
In this example, df_percent_change will contain the percentage change for each element in each column relative to the previous element. The fillna(0) is used to replace the first element's NaN value (which doesn't have a previous element to compare with) with 0%.

The resulting DataFrame will look like this:

css
Copy code
     A    B
0  0.00  0.00
1  0.20  0.10
2  0.25 -0.045455
3  0.20  0.142857
Now, each element in the DataFrame represents the percentage change relative to the previous element in the same column. The first row contains 0s because there is no previous element to compare with.

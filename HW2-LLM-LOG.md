#### My first question was about creating the function of top 25's. I did some changes in the code such as adding the dataframe as a parameter and turning it into a function with both ordering in descending and ascending order.

## Question1: I have a dataframe and I want to order it in a descending way by some column and get the top 25 values for that column .How do I do that in Python


## ChatGPT:
Easy peasy! If you're using pandas, you can do something like this:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Assuming your DataFrame is named 'df' and the column you want to sort by is 'your_column'
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='your_column', ascending=False)

#Now, you can get the top 25 values
top_25_values = sorted_df.head(25)
Just replace 'your_column' with the actual column name you want to sort by. If you're using a different library or have a different structure, let me know!



#### My second question was basically asking for a guide on how to create a heatmap.

### Question2: I have a dataframe with some coordinates and I want to create a heatmap  using folium library in Python. I also have a column called "population" and I want my heatmap to be designed so that it shows the sum of population for the indicated coordinates .How do I do that

### ChatGPT:
To create a heatmap using the Folium library in Python with the sum of population for the indicated coordinates, you can follow these steps:

Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install folium
Import the necessary libraries and read your DataFrame:
python
Copy code
import folium
from folium.plugins import HeatMap
import pandas as pd

#Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'df' with columns 'latitude', 'longitude', and 'population'
 Example:
 df = pd.DataFrame({'latitude': [37.7749, 34.0522, 40.7128],
                    'longitude': [-122.4194, -118.2437, -74.0060],
                    'population': [1000000, 1500000, 500000]})

 Replace the example data with your actual DataFrame
Create a base map using Folium:
python
Copy code
 Choose the center of your map based on the coordinates in your DataFrame
map_center = [df['latitude'].mean(), df['longitude'].mean()]

 Create a Folium Map object
my_map = folium.Map(location=map_center, zoom_start=10)
Add a heatmap layer with the sum of population:
python
Copy code
heat_data = [[point['latitude'], point['longitude'], point['population']] for index, point in df.iterrows()]

HeatMap(heat_data, radius=15, blur=20).add_to(my_map)
Adjust the radius and blur parameters according to your preference. These parameters control the size of the circles on the heatmap.

Save or display the map:
python
Copy code
 Save the map to an HTML file
my_map.save('heatmap.html')

 Display the map in a Jupyter notebook or script
my_map
Now you should have a Folium map with a heatmap that represents the sum of population at the specified coordinates. Adjust the parameters and map settings based on your specific needs.


### My third question was about getting the API link from GADM and pasting it to Chat GPT to understand how I can use it to create a shape data.

### Question 3 :"https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/gadm/gadm4.1/json/gadm41_TUR_2.json" how do I create a geopandas from this shape data. Does it link a geojson file?

### ChatGPT:
Yes, the URL you provided seems to lead to a GeoJSON file. You can use the geopandas library in Python to create a GeoDataFrame from GeoJSON data. Here's an example of how you can do it:

python
Copy code
import geopandas as gpd
import requests

#URL to the GeoJSON file
url = "https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/gadm/gadm4.1/json/gadm41_TUR_2.json"

 Download the GeoJSON data
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

#Create a GeoDataFrame
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_features(data['features'])

#Print the GeoDataFrame to see the structure
print(gdf.head())
This code uses the requests library to download the GeoJSON data from the given URL, and then it uses geopandas.GeoDataFrame.from_features() to create a GeoDataFrame from the GeoJSON features.

Make sure you have the geopandas and requests libraries installed. You can install them using:

bash
Copy code
pip install geopandas requests
After running this code, you should have a GeoDataFrame (gdf) that you can use for further analysis and visualization with the geopandas library.


### My fourth question was about The TÜİK level 1 data. I needed to specify a range in that excel file to tell python to get that spesific data frame from the sheet.

#### QUESTION4: I have an excel file which I want to create a df from. My problem is that the table starts from some spesific row and ends in a spesifc row and the same for the columns. How should I get it

### ChatGPT:
To create a DataFrame in Python using pandas from a specific range of rows and columns in an Excel file, you can use the read_excel function provided by pandas. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Specify the Excel file path
excel_file_path = 'path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx'

#Specify the starting and ending rows and columns
start_row = 2  # adjust as needed
end_row = 10    # adjust as needed
start_col = 'B' # adjust as needed
end_col = 'F'   # adjust as needed

#Generate the range for rows and columns
rows_range = f'{start_row}:{end_row}'
cols_range = f'{start_col}:{end_col}'

#Create the DataFrame from the specified range
df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path, sheet_name='Sheet1', skiprows=start_row - 1, usecols=cols_range)

#Print the resulting DataFrame
print(df)
In this example:

skiprows is used to skip the initial rows before the header. If your data starts from the first row, you can set skiprows=0.
usecols is used to specify the columns you want to include. You can set it to a specific range of columns.
Adjust the values of start_row, end_row, start_col, and end_col based on the actual location of your data in the Excel file. The sheet_name parameter specifies the sheet from which to read the data (replace 'Sheet1' with the actual sheet name in your Excel file).

Note: Make sure you have the pandas library installed. You can install it using pip install pandas if you haven't done so already.


### My fifth question was about merging dataframes. In each questions of this HW I needed to merge dataframes. This question was about merging two data frames not just one but two different columns.

### Question 5: I have some dataframes that I want to merge and I want to merge them by two columns. How can I do that in Python


### ChatGPT
In Python, you can use the merge function provided by the pandas library to merge dataframes based on specific columns. To merge by two columns, you can pass a list of column names to the on parameter. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Assuming you have two dataframes df1 and df2
df1 = pd.DataFrame({'key1': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
                    'key2': [1, 2, 3, 4],
                    'value': ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux']})

df2 = pd.DataFrame({'key1': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'E'],
                    'key2': [1, 2, 3, 5],
                    'value': ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'grape']})

#Merge dataframes on multiple columns
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on=['key1', 'key2'])

print(merged_df)
In this example, the on parameter is set to a list containing the column names 'key1' and 'key2'. This means the merge will be based on both 'key1' and 'key2' columns. The resulting merged_df will contain rows where both 'key1' and 'key2' match in both dataframes.

You can also use the how parameter to specify the type of merge (e.g., 'inner', 'outer', 'left', or 'right'). The default is 'inner'.

python
Copy code
#Example of an outer merge
merged_df_outer = pd.merge(df1, df2, on=['key1', 'key2'], how='outer')
print(merged_df_outer)
Make sure that the columns you want to merge on have the same name in both dataframes. If they have different names, you can use the left_on and right_on parameters to specify the columns for the left and right dataframes, respectively.



### My sixth question was about finding a function for obtaining years as a list . In SQL I knew that I could have done it with a "where in" statement. I needed to find the equivelant in python.

### Question6:  I need to filter my dataframe just like in sql. I need need to use "where in ". What is the correct way to do it in python.


### ChatGPT:
In Python, you can use the Pandas library to filter a DataFrame similar to using a WHERE IN clause in SQL. The isin() method in Pandas is particularly useful for this purpose. Here's an example:

Assuming you have a DataFrame called df and you want to filter rows where a particular column, let's say 'column_name', is in a list of values, you can use the isin() method as follows:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

#Sample DataFrame
data = {'column_name': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'other_column': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

#List of values to filter on
values_to_filter = [2, 4]

#Applying the filter
filtered_df = df[df['column_name'].isin(values_to_filter)]

#Display the filtered DataFrame
print(filtered_df)
In this example, filtered_df will contain only the rows where the 'column_name' is in the list [2, 4].

If you have multiple conditions, you can combine them using the & (and) or | (or) operators. For example:

python
Copy code
filtered_df = df[(df['column_name'].isin(values_to_filter)) & (df['other_column'] == 'B')]
This will filter the DataFrame to include only rows where 'column_name' is in the specified list and 'other_column' is equal to 'B'.




### My seventh question was about finding a way to implenet a linear regression test to statistically see the significenge of my relation from a scatterplot. It gave me a concise and great answer.

### Question7: How do i statistically show that there is a linear relation between the two column of my dataframe. I want to test them by their linear relation

#### ChatGPT:
To statistically show that there is a linear relationship between two columns in your DataFrame, you can perform a linear regression analysis. Here are the general steps using Python and popular libraries like NumPy and SciPy:

Assuming you have a DataFrame df with columns X and Y:

Import necessary libraries:
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import linregress
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Prepare your data:
Make sure that your DataFrame has non-null values in the columns of interest. If there are missing values, you may need to handle them appropriately (e.g., by removing or imputing).

python
Copy code
#Assuming X and Y are the column names
X = df['X']
Y = df['Y']
Perform linear regression:
Use linregress from SciPy to get the slope, intercept, correlation coefficient, p-value, and standard error of the regression.

python
Copy code
slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(X, Y)
Check the statistical significance:
The p-value will help you determine if the linear relationship is statistically significant. If the p-value is less than a chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis that there is no linear relationship.

python
Copy code
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("The linear relationship is statistically significant.")
else:
    print("There is no statistically significant linear relationship.")
Visualize the linear regression line:
Plot the data points and the regression line to visually assess the fit.

python
Copy code
plt.scatter(X, Y, label='Data points')
plt.plot(X, intercept + slope * X, 'r', label='Linear regression line')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
This code will create a scatter plot with the data points and a red line representing the linear regression line.

Remember that correlation does not imply causation, and while a linear relationship may exist, it doesn't necessarily mean that one variable causes the other. Additionally, consider checking assumptions of linear regression, such as homoscedasticity and normality of residuals, for a more robust analysis.
